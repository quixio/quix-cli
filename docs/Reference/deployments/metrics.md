## How It Works

This command retrieves and displays real-time metrics for a specified deployment. It helps you monitor the performance and resource usage of your deployments, providing insights into memory, CPU usage, and the last update times for each replica.

## Example Usage

{% include-markdown '../utils/tip-use.md' %}

The `quix deployment metrics` command is used to retrieve and display real-time metrics for a specific deployment. Below are examples showcasing how to use this command:

### Interactive Mode

If no deployment ID is provided, the command will prompt you to select a workspace and deployment interactively:

```bash
$ quix deployment metrics
? Select deployment:
  deployment-1
  deployment-2
  deployment-3
> deployment-4
  âœ— Cancel

Deployment metrics for deployment-4
Deployment ID: deployment-4

| Replica | Memory (MB) | CPU (millicores) | Last Update        |
|---------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 0       | 512          | 1000             | 2024-06-12 12:40:00|
| 1       | 256          | 500              | 2024-06-12 12:40:05|
```

### Non-Interactive Mode

If you know the deployment ID, you can provide it directly as an argument:

```bash
$ quix deployment metrics my-deployment-id

Deployment metrics for my-deployment
Deployment ID: my-deployment-id

| Replica | Memory (MB) | CPU (millicores) | Last Update        |
|---------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 0       | 256          | 500              | 2024-06-12 12:34:56|
| 1       | 128          | 250              | 2024-06-12 12:35:00|
```
