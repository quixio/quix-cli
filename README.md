Welcome to Quix CLI, your powerful command-line companion for seamlessly managing and interacting with the features of our Quix Cloud product. While Quix offers a robust Frontend UI for a user-friendly experience, the CLI empowers you with efficiency and flexibility, allowing you to streamline your workflow and take control from the command line.

- **Effortless Control:** Execute commands effortlessly to manage various aspects of your Quix organisation.
  
- **Script Automation:** Integrate Quix operations into your scripts for automated workflows and enhanced productivity.

- **Accessibility:** Access and manipulate Quix features directly from the command line, providing an alternative interface for users who prefer terminal-based interactions.

- **Scalability:** Seamlessly scale your Quix operations, whether you are working on a single instance or orchestrating tasks across multiple environments.

Quix CLI is designed to be intuitive, consistent, and respectful of user preferences following [CLI design best practices](https://clig.dev/).
