# Quix Command Line Interface (CLI)

The **Quix CLI** is a free tool designed to help you create, debug, and run streaming pipelines locally using Docker and Quix Streams. It also serves as a companion app for managing and interacting with your [Quix Cloud](https://quix.io/docs/quix-cloud/overview.md) account. While Quix Cloud offers a robust frontend UI for a user-friendly experience, the CLI provides efficiency and flexibility, allowing you to streamline your workflow and take control from the command line.

**Quix CLI** streamlines your workflow by offering three core categories of functionality:

1. **Local Commands**: Develop and test your streaming pipelines locally. Use predefined samples or write custom code in Python with Quix Streams. The CLI enables you to run these pipelines in Docker containers for seamless testing and debugging. When ready, you can deploy and synchronize your local pipelines directly to Quix Cloud.

2. **Cloud Commands**: Manage your Quix Cloud account with precision and efficiency right from the command line. While the Quix Cloud UI offers a comprehensive interface, the CLI accelerates your workflow, making complex tasks more accessible.

3. **Utility Commands**: Handle essential tasks such as checking your status, updating the CLI, adjusting configurations, accessing interactive help, and managing contexts (i.e., defining the endpoint or environment the CLI connects to).
