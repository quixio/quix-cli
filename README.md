## Installation of Quix CLI

To install the Quix CLI, users have multiple methods depending on their operating system. Here's an expanded installation section including the main ways to install Quix CLI on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

**Note:** Replace `{version}` with the actual version number you intend to install (e.g., `1.2.3`). Omitting the `{version}` parameter will automatically default to installing the latest available version of Quix CLI.

### For Linux and macOS:

Install the Quix CLI using the Curl commands in your terminal. Choose between installing the latest version or specifying a specific version. For installations that modify system-wide settings, elevated privileges may be required.

- **Install Latest Version without Specifying Version:**

  ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/quixio/quix-cli/raw/cli-install-scripts/install.sh | bash
  ```
  
- **Install Specific Version:**

  ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/quixio/quix-cli/raw/cli-install-scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- -v={version}
  ```

    Elevated Privileges Instructions
  </summary>
  If your user account lacks the necessary permissions to install software globally, you might need to execute the commands with elevated privileges. Use `sudo` to grant these privileges as shown:

  - **Install Latest Version with Elevated Privileges:**

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/quixio/quix-cli/raw/cli-install-scripts/install.sh | sudo bash
    ```
    
  - **Install Specific Version with Elevated Privileges:**

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/quixio/quix-cli/raw/cli-install-scripts/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -v={version}
    ```
</details>

### For Windows (PowerShell):

- **Using PowerShell without Version (installs latest):**

  ```powershell
  iwr https://github.com/quixio/quix-cli/raw/cli-install-scripts/install.ps1 -useb | iex
  ```
  
- **Using PowerShell with Version:**

  ```powershell
  $quixCliInstall = (iwr https://github.com/quixio/quix-cli/raw/cli-install-scripts/install.ps1 -useb).Content; iex "$quixCliInstall {version}"
  ```

#### Notes:

- **Permissions:** You may need to run these commands with elevated privileges. On Linux and macOS, use `sudo` if necessary. On Windows, run PowerShell as an Administrator.
- **Version Specification:** The `{version}` parameter is optional. If you know the specific version of Quix CLI you need, replace `{version}` with that version number (e.g., `1.2.3`). If you omit it, the script typically installs the latest version.
- **PATH Verification:** After installation, ensure that the directory where Quix CLI is installed is included in your system's PATH.
